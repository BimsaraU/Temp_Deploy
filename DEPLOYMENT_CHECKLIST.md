## Backend Service Deployment

### âœ… Backend Setup in Railway

- [ ] Created new service from GitHub repo
- [ ] Set **Root Directory**: `hrgsms-backend`
- [ ] Railway detected Dockerfile

### âœ… Backend Environment Variables

Add these in Railway Backend Service â†’ Variables tab:

- [ ] `DB_PORT=33570`
- [ ] `DB_USER=root`
- [ ] `DB_PASSWORD=ekDohXiaRAaEoHDorsgNysuKRgMGEOZv`
- [ ] `DB_NAME=railway`
- [ ] `JWT_SECRET=` (Generated secure 32+ character string)
- [ ] `JWT_ALGORITHM=HS256`
- [ ] `JWT_EXP_MINUTES=1440`
- [ ] `APP_ENV=production`

**Generate JWT_SECRET:**
```bash
openssl rand -hex 32
# OR
python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))"
```

### âœ… Backend Domain

- [ ] Build completed successfully
- [ ] Generated public domain (Settings â†’ Networking â†’ Generate Domain)
- [ ] Copied backend URL: `https://_____.up.railway.app`
- [ ] Tested health endpoint: `https://your-backend.up.railway.app/health`
- [ ] Tested API docs: `https://your-backend.up.railway.app/docs`

**My Backend URL:** _________________________________

## Frontend Service Deployment

### âœ… Frontend Setup in Railway

- [ ] Created new service from GitHub repo
- [ ] Set **Root Directory**: `hrgsms-frontend`
- [ ] Railway detected Dockerfile

### âœ… Frontend Environment Variables

Add these in Railway Frontend Service â†’ Variables tab:

- [ ] `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=` (Your backend Railway URL)
- [ ] `NODE_ENV=production`

### âœ… Frontend Domain

- [ ] Build completed successfully
- [ ] Generated public domain (Settings â†’ Networking â†’ Generate Domain)
- [ ] Copied frontend URL: `https://_____.up.railway.app`
- [ ] Frontend loads successfully

**My Frontend URL:** _________________________________

## Final Configuration

### âœ… Update Backend CORS

Go back to Backend Service â†’ Variables and add:

- [ ] `FRONTEND_URL=` (Your frontend Railway URL)
- [ ] Backend redeployed automatically
- [ ] Verified frontend can communicate with backend

---

## Testing & Verification

### âœ… Backend Tests

- [ ] Health check responds: `curl https://your-backend.up.railway.app/health`
- [ ] API documentation loads: `https://your-backend.up.railway.app/docs`
- [ ] Database connection verified in health check response

### âœ… Frontend Tests

- [ ] Frontend loads without errors
- [ ] Login page accessible
- [ ] Can create new account (register)
- [ ] Can login with test credentials
- [ ] Dashboard loads after login
- [ ] Can navigate between pages
- [ ] No CORS errors in browser console

### âœ… Integration Tests

- [ ] Login functionality works
- [ ] Can create new guest
- [ ] Can create new reservation
- [ ] Can view rooms
- [ ] Can manage services
- [ ] Can process payments
- [ ] Reports load correctly

---

## Post-Deployment

### âœ… Security

- [ ] JWT_SECRET is strong and unique (32+ characters)
- [ ] Database credentials not committed to Git
- [ ] `.env` and `.env.railway` in `.gitignore`
- [ ] 2FA enabled on Railway account
- [ ] Reviewed who has access to Railway project

### âœ… Monitoring

- [ ] Set up Railway notifications
- [ ] Bookmarked Railway dashboard
- [ ] Know how to access logs (Deployments â†’ View Logs)
- [ ] Understand Railway metrics (Metrics tab)

### âœ… Documentation

- [ ] Saved backend URL for team
- [ ] Saved frontend URL for team
- [ ] Documented any custom configurations
- [ ] Updated project README if needed

### âœ… Backup

- [ ] Documented database backup procedure
- [ ] Know how to export database:
  ```bash
  mysqldump -h nozomi.proxy.rlwy.net -P 33570 -u root -pekDohXiaRAaEoHDorsgNysuKRgMGEOZv railway > backup.sql
  ```
- [ ] Scheduled regular backups (if applicable)

## Troubleshooting Reference

### Backend Issues

**Can't connect to database:**
- Check environment variables are exactly correct
- Verify MySQL service is running
- Check Railway backend logs

**Build fails:**
- Check Railway build logs
- Verify Dockerfile exists in `hrgsms-backend/`
- Check requirements.txt has all dependencies

### Frontend Issues

**Can't reach backend:**
- Verify NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL is correct
- Check backend is running
- Look for CORS errors in browser console

**Build fails:**
- Check Railway build logs
- Verify Dockerfile exists in `hrgsms-frontend/`
- Check package.json has all dependencies

### CORS Errors

- Verify FRONTEND_URL is set in backend environment variables
- Check frontend URL matches exactly (including https://)
- Backend should redeploy after adding FRONTEND_URL

---

## Success Criteria

Your deployment is successful when:

âœ… Database has all tables and seed data  
âœ… Backend health check returns "healthy"  
âœ… Backend API docs load  
âœ… Frontend loads without errors  
âœ… Can login and access all features  
âœ… No CORS errors in browser console  
âœ… All CRUD operations work (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
