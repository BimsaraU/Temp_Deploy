# Railway Deployment Guide - HRGSMS

This guide will help you deploy the HRGSMS application to Railway.

## Prerequisites

- Railway account (sign up at https://railway.app)
- GitHub account with your repository
- Basic understanding of environment variables

## Architecture

Your application will be deployed as 3 separate Railway services:
1. **MySQL Database** - Railway's MySQL plugin
2. **Backend API** - FastAPI application
3. **Frontend** - Next.js application

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Create a New Railway Project

1. Go to https://railway.app
2. Click "New Project"
3. Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
4. Authorize Railway to access your repository
5. Select your `Temp_Deploy` repository

### 2. Deploy MySQL Database

1. In your Railway project, click "New Service"
2. Select "Database" â†’ "Add MySQL"
3. Railway will automatically provision a MySQL database
4. Note the connection details from the "Variables" tab:
   - `MYSQL_URL`
   - `MYSQL_HOST`
   - `MYSQL_PORT`
   - `MYSQL_USER`
   - `MYSQL_PASSWORD`
   - `MYSQL_DATABASE`

#### Initialize Database Schema

You have two options to initialize the database:

**Option A: Using Railway MySQL Client**
1. Click on the MySQL service
2. Go to "Data" tab
3. Click "Query"
4. Copy and paste the contents of each SQL file in this order:
   - `hrgsms-db/schema.sql`
   - `hrgsms-db/procedures.sql`
   - `hrgsms-db/functions.sql`
   - `hrgsms-db/triggers.sql`
   - `hrgsms-db/seed_data.sql`
5. Execute each file

**Option B: Using MySQL Client Locally**
```bash
# Connect to Railway MySQL from your local machine
mysql -h [MYSQL_HOST] -P [MYSQL_PORT] -u [MYSQL_USER] -p[MYSQL_PASSWORD] [MYSQL_DATABASE]

# Then run each SQL file
source hrgsms-db/schema.sql;
source hrgsms-db/procedures.sql;
source hrgsms-db/functions.sql;
source hrgsms-db/triggers.sql;
source hrgsms-db/seed_data.sql;
```

### 3. Deploy Backend API

1. In your Railway project, click "New Service"
2. Select "GitHub Repo" â†’ Choose your repository
3. Set the **Root Directory** to: `hrgsms-backend`
4. Railway will automatically detect the Dockerfile

#### Configure Backend Environment Variables

Click on the backend service â†’ "Variables" tab â†’ Add the following:

```bash
# Database Configuration (Reference from MySQL service)
DB_HOST=${{MySQL.MYSQL_HOST}}
DB_PORT=${{MySQL.MYSQL_PORT}}
DB_USER=${{MySQL.MYSQL_USER}}
DB_PASSWORD=${{MySQL.MYSQL_PASSWORD}}
DB_NAME=${{MySQL.MYSQL_DATABASE}}

# JWT Configuration
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-key-change-this-in-production
JWT_ALGORITHM=HS256
JWT_EXP_MINUTES=1440

# Application Environment
APP_ENV=production
```

**Note:** Railway allows you to reference variables from other services using `${{ServiceName.VARIABLE_NAME}}` syntax.

#### Generate Public Domain

1. Click on the backend service
2. Go to "Settings" tab
3. Scroll to "Networking"
4. Click "Generate Domain"
5. Copy the generated URL (e.g., `https://your-backend.up.railway.app`)

### 4. Deploy Frontend

1. In your Railway project, click "New Service"
2. Select "GitHub Repo" â†’ Choose your repository
3. Set the **Root Directory** to: `hrgsms-frontend`
4. Railway will automatically detect the Dockerfile

#### Configure Frontend Environment Variables

Click on the frontend service â†’ "Variables" tab â†’ Add the following:

```bash
# API Configuration (use the backend domain from step 3)
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://your-backend.up.railway.app

# Node Environment
NODE_ENV=production
```

#### Generate Public Domain

1. Click on the frontend service
2. Go to "Settings" tab
3. Scroll to "Networking"
4. Click "Generate Domain"
5. Copy the generated URL (e.g., `https://your-frontend.up.railway.app`)

### 5. Configure CORS (Backend)

Update your backend CORS settings to allow requests from your frontend domain:

1. Edit `hrgsms-backend/app/main.py`
2. Add your Railway frontend domain to allowed origins:

```python
from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware

app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=[
        "http://localhost:3000",
        "https://your-frontend.up.railway.app"  # Add this
    ],
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["*"],
    allow_headers=["*"],
)
```

3. Commit and push changes - Railway will automatically redeploy

## Verification

### Test Backend API

Visit: `https://your-backend.up.railway.app/docs`

You should see the FastAPI Swagger documentation.

### Test Frontend

Visit: `https://your-frontend.up.railway.app`

You should see your HRGSMS application.

## Service URLs

After deployment, you'll have:

- **Database**: Internal Railway network (MySQL)
- **Backend API**: `https://your-backend.up.railway.app`
- **Frontend**: `https://your-frontend.up.railway.app`
- **API Docs**: `https://your-backend.up.railway.app/docs`

## Monitoring and Logs

### View Logs

1. Click on any service in Railway
2. Go to "Deployments" tab
3. Click on the latest deployment
4. View real-time logs

### View Metrics

1. Click on any service
2. Go to "Metrics" tab
3. View CPU, Memory, and Network usage

## Troubleshooting

### Backend won't connect to database

- Verify database environment variables are correctly referenced
- Check that database service is healthy
- Ensure database schema is initialized

### Frontend can't reach backend

- Verify `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` is set correctly
- Check backend CORS configuration includes frontend domain
- Ensure backend service is running

### Database connection timeout

- Check that all SQL files were executed successfully
- Verify MySQL service is running
- Check Railway service logs for detailed errors

### Build failures

- Check Railway build logs
- Verify Dockerfile syntax
- Ensure all dependencies are listed in requirements.txt/package.json

## Updating Your Application

Railway automatically redeploys when you push to your GitHub repository:

1. Make changes to your code
2. Commit and push to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Your commit message"
   git push origin master
   ```
3. Railway will automatically detect changes and redeploy affected services

## Cost Optimization

Railway offers:
- **$5 free credit per month** for Hobby plan
- Pay-as-you-go pricing after free credits

To optimize costs:
1. Monitor resource usage in Railway dashboard
2. Scale down services when not in use
3. Use Railway's sleep feature for development environments

## Custom Domains (Optional)

To use your own domain:

1. Click on frontend service â†’ "Settings" â†’ "Networking"
2. Click "Custom Domain"
3. Add your domain (e.g., `hrgsms.yourdomain.com`)
4. Add the provided CNAME record to your DNS provider
5. Wait for DNS propagation (usually 5-30 minutes)

Repeat for backend if needed.

## Security Recommendations

1. âœ… Use strong, unique `JWT_SECRET`
2. âœ… Enable Railway's private networking for database
3. âœ… Regularly update dependencies
4. âœ… Monitor Railway logs for suspicious activity
5. âœ… Use Railway's environment variable groups for multiple environments
6. âœ… Enable 2FA on your Railway account

## Backup Strategy

Railway MySQL includes automatic backups, but you should also:

1. Use Railway's built-in backup feature
2. Export database regularly:
   ```bash
   mysqldump -h [HOST] -P [PORT] -u [USER] -p[PASSWORD] [DATABASE] > backup.sql
   ```
3. Store backups in a separate location (AWS S3, Google Drive, etc.)
